<p>We aim to improve our websites accessibility on a regular and continuous basis. See the section below ('What we're doing to improve accessibility') on how we are improving our site accessibility.</p>

<p>We are working towards solving these problems and expect a first series of improvements by October 2025, followed by additional improvements by June 2026. The site is fully within our control.</p>

<h2>Disproportionate burden</h2>

<p>We are not currently claiming that any accessibility problems would be a disproportionate burden to fix.</p>

<h2>Content that's not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h2>

<p>At this time we believe no content is outwith the scope of the accessibility regulations.</p>

<h2>What we're doing to improve accessibility</h2>

<p>We will continue to address and make adequate improvements to the accessibility issues highlighted. Unless specified otherwise, a complete solution or significant improvement will be in place by June 2026.</p>

<p>While we are in the process of resolving these accessibility issues we will ensure reasonable adjustments are in place to make sure no user is disadvantaged. As changes are made, we will continue to review accessibility and retest the accessibility of this website.</p>

<h2>Preparation of this accessibility statement</h2>

<p><strong>This statement was prepared on 6th August 2025. It was last reviewed on 6th August 2025.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The website was last tested on 4th August 2025. The testing was carried out by the BioRDM team and the Disability Information Service at the University of Edinburgh</strong> using both automated and manual methods. The site was tested on a PC, primarily using Microsoft Edge alongside Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.</p>

<p>Recent world-wide usage levels survey for different screen readers and browsers shows that Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge are increasing in popularity and Google Chrome is now the favoured browser for screen readers:</p>

<p><a href="https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey10/">WebAIM: Screen Reader User Survey</a></p>

<p>The aforementioned three browsers have been used in certain questions for reasons of breadth and variety.</p>

<p>We ran automated testing using <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/axe-devtools-web-accessib/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd">AXE</a> (Google Chrome extension) and then manual testing that included:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Spell check functionality;</li>
    <li>Scaling using different resolutions and reflow;</li>
    <li>Options to customise the interface (magnification, font, background colour, etc);</li>
    <li>Keyboard navigation and keyboard traps;</li>
    <li>Data validation;</li>
    <li>Warning of links opening in new tab or window;</li>
    <li>Information conveyed in the colour or sound only;</li>
    <li>Flashing, moving or scrolling text;</li>
    <li>Use with screen reading software (for example JAWS);</li>
    <li>Assistive software (TextHelp Read and Write, Windows Magnifier, ZoomText, Dragon Naturally Speaking, TalkBack and VoiceOver);</li>
    <li>Tooltips and text alternatives for any non-text content;</li>
    <li>Time limits;</li>
    <li>Compatibility with mobile accessibility functionality (Android and iOS);</li>
    <li>Any drag functionality and alternatives;</li>
    <li>Consistent help function;</li>
    <li>Submission and re-entry of data;</li>
    <li>Any cognitive tests.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Change Log</h2>

<p>This section will receive updates as and when accessibility improvements are made to the website.</p>
